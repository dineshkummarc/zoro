### I want to create a PR.

1.  Please create a issue first
2.  Don't use internal package
4.  Single function better than multiple functions
5.  Single file better than multiple files
6.  Single directory better than multiple multiple directories
7.  Prefer struct and function to be exported.
8.  Keep it simple, stupid
